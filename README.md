# LipNet: Lip Reading with Deep Learning 👄

A deep learning model that can read lips from silent video clips with surprising accuracy.

-----

## 📖 Overview

This project implements the LipNet model, a deep neural network that performs lip-reading, also known as visual speech recognition. Given a silent video of a person speaking, LipNet can predict the spoken words. This technology has the potential to help people with hearing impairments, improve voice recognition systems in noisy environments, and enable new forms of human-computer interaction. This implementation provides a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and a web-based interface for live predictions.

## ✨ Features

  * **End-to-End Lip Reading:** A complete pipeline for training and deploying a lip-reading model.
  * **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by Bidirectional LSTMs to capture spatiotemporal features from video frames.
  * **Web Interface:** A user-friendly web application built with Flask to upload and test videos.
  * **Data Version Control:** DVC is used to manage large data files and model weights.
  * **Reproducible Pipeline:** The entire workflow is defined in a `dvc.yaml` file for easy reproduction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **Programming Language:** Python
  * **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow, Keras
  * **Web Framework:** Flask
  * **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, gdown, tqdm, PyYAML
  * **Tools:** DVC (Data Version Control), Git

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lipnet-lip-reading.git
    cd lipnet-lip-reading
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download the data and model weights using DVC:**

    ```bash
    dvc pull
    ```

-----

## kullanım

1.  **Run the Flask web application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
3.  Select a video file from the dropdown and click "Predict". The predicted text will be displayed below the video.

### Example Usage (CLI)

To make a prediction on a single video file from the command line:

```bash
python src/predict.py --video_path path/to/your/video.mpg
```

-----

## 📈 Results / Visuals

The model is trained on the GRID corpus dataset and achieves a high accuracy in predicting the spoken words.

Here's an example of the model's prediction on a sample video from the dataset:

*Actual Text:* "bin blue at a one now"
*Predicted Text:* "bin blue at a one now"

-----

## 🔮 Future Improvements

  * Train the model on a larger and more diverse dataset to improve its generalization.
  * Implement a real-time lip-reading system using a webcam.
  * Experiment with different model architectures like Transformers.
  * Deploy the application to a cloud platform for public access.
